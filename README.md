## 🛠️ Topology
- 2 PCs  
- 1 Switch  
- Copper Straight-Through cables


---

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Device | IP Address     | Subnet Mask       | Default Gateway |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| PC1    | 192.168.1.10   | 255.255.255.0     | *none*           |
| PC2    | 192.168.1.11   | 255.255.255.0     | *none*           |

## 📡 Test – Ping

- PC1 → PC2: ✅ Successful  
- PC2 → PC1: ✅ Successful

> Ping was successful in both directions, confirming that the LAN is functional.

---

## ✅ Result
✔️ Successfully created a basic LAN  
✔️ Assigned static IP addresses  
✔️ Verified connectivity with Ping
